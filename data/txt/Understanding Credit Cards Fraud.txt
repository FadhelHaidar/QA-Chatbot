"Understanding Credit Card Frauds

Card Related Frauds

**APPLICATION FRAUD**

This type of fraud occurs when a person falsifies an application to acquire a credit card. Application fraud can be committed in three ways:

*   Assumed identity, where an individual illegally obtains personal information of another individual and opens accounts in his or her name, using partially legitimate information.
*   Financial fraud, where an individual provides false information about his or her financial status to acquire credit.
*   Not-received items (NRIs) also called postal interceptions occur when a card is stolen from the postal service before it reaches its owner's destination.

**LOST / STOLEN CARDS**

A card is lost/stolen when a legitimate account holder receives a card and loses it or someone steals the card for criminal purposes. This type of fraud is in essence the easiest way for a fraudster to get hold of other individual's credit cards without investment in technology. It is also perhaps the hardest form of traditional credit card fraud to tackle.

**ACCOUNT TAKEOVER**

This type of fraud occurs when a fraudster illegitimately obtains a valid customer's personal information. The fraudster takes control of (takeover) a legitimate account by either providing the customers account number or the card number. The fraudster then contacts the card issuer, masquerading as the genuine cardholder, to ask that mail be redirected to a new address. The fraudster reports card lost and asks for a replacement to be sent.

**FAKE AND COUNTERFEIT CARDS**

The creation of counterfeit cards, together with lost / stolen cards pose highest threat in credit card frauds. Fraudsters are constantly finding new and more innovative ways to create counterfeit cards. Some of the techniques used for creating false and counterfeit cards are listed below:

1.  **Erasing the magnetic strip**: A fraudster can tamper an existing card that has been acquired illegally by erasing the metallic strip with a powerful electro-magnet. The fraudster then tampers with the details on the card so that they match the details of a valid card, which they may have attained, e.g., from a stolen till roll. When the fraudster begins to use the card, the cashier will swipe the card through the terminal several times, before realizing that the metallic strip does not work. The cashier will then proceed to manually input the card details into the terminal. This form of fraud has high risk because the cashier will be looking at the card closely to read the numbers. Doctored cards are, as with many of the traditional methods of credit card fraud, becoming an outdated method of illicit accumulation of either funds or goods.
2.  **Creating a fake card**: A fraudster can create a fake card from scratch using sophisticated machines. This is the most common type of fraud though fake cards require a lot of effort and skill to produce. Modern cards have many security features all designed to make it difficult for fraudsters to make good quality forgeries. Holograms have been introduced in almost all credit cards and are very difficult to

The text appears to be a page from a document or report discussing various types of credit card frauds, including application fraud, lost or stolen cards, account takeover, and fake and counterfeit cards.The image presents a page from a document titled "Understanding Credit Card Frauds" and is labeled as page 5 of 5. The content is divided into sections, each addressing various types of credit card fraud.

*   **Altering card details**: This section discusses how fraudsters can alter cards by either re-embossing them or re-encoding them using computer software that encodes the magnetic stripe data on the card.
*   **Skimming**: This section explains that most cases of counterfeit fraud involve skimming, a process where genuine data on a card's magnetic stripe is electronically copied onto another. Skimming is fast emerging as the most popular form of credit card fraud.
*   **White plastic**: A white plastic is a card-size piece of plastic of any color that a fraudster creates and encodes with legitimate magnetic stripe data for illegal transactions.
*   **Merchant Related Frauds**: Merchant related frauds are initiated either by owners of the merchant establishment or their employees. The types of frauds initiated by merchants are described below:
    *   **MERCHANT COLLUSION**: This type of fraud occurs when merchant owners and/or their employees conspire to commit fraud using their customers' (cardholder) accounts and/or personal information. Merchant owners and/or their employees pass on the information about cardholders to fraudsters.
    *   **TRIANGULATION**: The fraudster in this type of fraud operates from a web site. Goods are offered at heavily discounted rates and are also shipped before payment. The fraudulent site appears to be a legitimate auction or a traditional sales site. The customer while placing orders online provides information such as name, address, and valid credit card details to the site. Once fraudsters receive these details, they order goods from a legitimate site using stolen credit card details. The fraudster then goes on to purchase other goods using the credit card numbers of the customer. This process is designed to cause a great deal of initial confusion, and the fraudulent internet company can in this manner operate long enough to accumulate vast amounts of goods purchased with stolen credit card numbers.
*   **Internet Related Frauds**: The Internet has provided an ideal ground for fraudsters to commit credit card fraud in an easy manner. Fraudsters have recently begun to operate on a truly transnational basis.

In summary, the document provides an overview of different types of credit card frauds, including altering card details, skimming, white plastic, merchant-related frauds, and internet-related frauds. It highlights the methods used by fraudsters to commit these crimes and the impact they have on individuals and businesses.The image displays information related to credit-card fraud. The text is divided into three sections, each discussing a different aspect of credit-card fraud. The sections are:

*   **Site Cloning**: This section explains how fraudsters clone entire websites or specific pages to deceive customers into believing they are dealing with a legitimate company. The cloned site appears identical to the real one, and customers unknowingly provide their credit-card details, which are then sent to the fraudster via email.
*   **False Merchant Sites**: This section describes how false merchant sites offer extremely cheap services and request customers' complete credit-card details in return for access to the content. These sites claim to be free but require a valid credit-card number to verify an individual's age. They accumulate as many credit-card numbers as possible, never charging individuals for their services. The sites are usually part of a larger criminal network that uses the collected details to raise revenues or sells valid credit-card details to small fraudsters.
*   **Credit-Card Generators**: This section explains how credit-card generators are computer programs that generate valid credit-card numbers and expiry dates. These generators work by generating lists of credit-card account numbers from a single account number. The software uses the mathematical Luhn algorithm that card issuers use to generate other valid card number combinations. The generators allow users to generate as many numbers as they desire, in any of the credit-card formats, whether it be American Express, Visa, or MasterCard.

The image also includes a section titled "IMPACT OF CREDIT CARD FRAUDS" and a subsection titled "Impact on Cardholders." The main points discussed in these sections are:

*   **Impact of Credit Card Frauds**: Unfortunately, occurrences of credit-card frauds have only shown an upward trend so far. The fraudulent activity on a card affects everybody, i.e., the cardholder, the merchant, the acquirer, as well as the issuer. This section analyses the impact that credit-card frauds have on all the players involved in transacting business through credit cards.
*   **Impact on Cardholders**: It's interesting to note that cardholders are the least impacted party due to fraud in credit-card transactions as consumer liability is limited for credit-card transactions by the legislation prevailing in most countries. This is true for both card-present as well as card-not-present scenarios. Many banks even have their own standards that limit the consumer's liability to a greater extent. They also have a cardholder protection policy in place that covers for most losses of the cardholder. The cardholder has to just report suspicious charges to the issuing bank, which in turn investigates the issue with the acquirer and merchant, and processes chargeback for the disputed amount.

Overall, the image effectively conveys information about credit card frauds and the measures taken to prevent them, providing a clear and concise overview of the topic.The text from the image is as follows:

**Understanding Credit Card Frauds**

**LOCKOUT MECHANISMS**

Automatic card number generators represent one of the new technological tools frequently utilized by fraudsters. These programs, easily downloadable from the Web, are able to generate thousands of 'valid' credit card numbers. The traits of frauds initiated by a card number generator are the following:
    â¢ Multiple transactions with similar card numbers (e.g. same Bank Identification Number (BIN))
    â¢ A large number of declines

Acquiring banks/merchant sites can put in place prevention mechanisms specifically designed to detect number generator attacks.

**FRAUDULENT MERCHANTS**

Both MasterCard and Visa publish a list of merchants who have been known for being involved in fraudulent transactions in the past. These lists (NMAS - from Visa and MATCH - from MasterCard) could provide useful information to acquirers right at the time of merchant recruitment preventing potential fraudulent transactions.

**Recent Developments in Fraud Management**

The technology for detecting credit card frauds is advancing at a rapid pace - rules based systems, neural networks, chip cards and biometrics are some of the popular techniques employed by Issuing and Acquiring banks these days.

Apart from technological advances, another trend which has emerged during the recent years is that fraud prevention is moving from back-office transaction processing systems to front-office authorisation systems to prevent committing of potentially fraudulent transactions. However, this is a challenging trade-off between the response time for processing an authorisation request and extent of screening that should be carried out.

**SIMPLE RULE SYSTEMS**

Simple rule systems involve the creation of 'if...then' criteria to filter incoming authorisations/transactions. Rule-based systems rely on a set of expert rules designed to identify specific types of high-risk transactions. Rules are created using the knowledge of what characterizes fraudulent transactions. For instance, a rule could look like - If transaction amount is > $5000 and card acceptance location = Casino and Country = 'a high-risk country'.

Fraud rules enable to automate the screening processes leveraging on the knowledge gained over time regarding the characteristics of both fraudulent and legitimate transactions. Typically, the effectiveness of a rule-based system will increase over time, as more rules are added to the system. It should be clear, however, that ultimately the effectiveness of the system depends on the knowledge and expertise of the person designing the rules.

The disadvantage of this solution is that it can increase the probability of throwing many valid transactions as exceptions, however, there are ways by which this limitation can be overcome to some extent by prioritising the rules and fixing limits on number of filtered transactions.

Page 10 of 10The image presents a page from a document titled "Understanding Credit Card Frauds," which is part of a larger report or presentation. The content is divided into three main sections, each focusing on a different aspect of credit card fraud detection.

**Section 1: Risk Scoring Technologies**

*   This section discusses the use of statistical models to identify fraudulent transactions based on various indicators derived from transaction characteristics.
*   It highlights the advantages of risk scoring systems, including their ability to provide a comprehensive evaluation of transactions and flag suspicious activity.
*   The section also explains how risk scoring can help prioritize transactions for manual review, allowing for more efficient and effective fraud detection.

**Section 2: Neural Network Technologies**

*   This section delves into the application of neural networks in credit card fraud detection.
*   It describes how neural networks are trained using historical transaction data to recognize patterns and identify fraudulent activity.
*   The section outlines the tasks performed by neural networks, including identifying cardholder buying patterns, processing data, and finding relationships in transaction data.
*   It also highlights the advantages of using neural networks, such as their ability to learn from past data and improve results over time.

**Section 3: Biometrics**

*   This section introduces biometrics as a fraud prevention technique that records unique characteristics of cardholders, such as fingerprints or signatures.
*   It explains how biometrics can be used to verify the identity of cardholders and prevent fraudulent transactions.

In summary, the image provides an overview of three key technologies used in credit card fraud detection: risk scoring, neural networks, and biometrics. Each section offers insights into the benefits and applications of these technologies, highlighting their potential to enhance the security and efficiency of credit card transactions.The image presents a page from a document titled "Understanding Credit Card Frauds" and is attributed to Tata Consultancy Services. The content is divided into three main sections: an introduction, a detailed explanation of smart cards, and a conclusion.

*   **Introduction**
    *   The introduction discusses the use of biometrics as a means to identify individuals through unique physical or behavioral characteristics.
    *   It highlights that various types of biometric systems are under development, including fingerprint verification, hand-based verification, retinal and iris scanning, and dynamic signature verification.
    *   Biometrics seem to supersede PINs as the basis for the next generation of personal identity verification systems.
*   **Smart Cards**
    *   A smart card is defined as a credit card with embedded intelligence in the form of a CPU.
    *   Smart cards operate similarly to their magnetic counterparts but offer additional security features.
    *   They contain a 32-kilobyte microprocessor capable of generating 72 quadrillion or more possible encryption keys, making it practically impossible to fraudulently decode information on the chip.
    *   The smart chip has made credit cards more secure, but the technology is still being implemented alongside the magnetic strip due to slow uptake of smart card-reading terminals worldwide.
    *   Smart cards have evolved significantly over the past decade, offering several advantages compared to general-purpose magnetic stripe cards.
    *   The advantages include:
        *   Storing many times more information than a magnetic stripe card.
        *   Being reliable and harder to tamper with than a magnetic stripe card.
        *   Performing multiple functions in various industries.
        *   Being compatible with portable electronic devices, such as phones and personal digital assistants (PDAs), and PCs.
        *   Storing highly sensitive data, such as signing or encryption keys, in a highly secure manner.
        *   Performing certain sensitive operations using signing or encryption keys in a secure fashion.
*   **Conclusion**
    *   A consortium of Europay MasterCard and Visa (EMV) recently issued a set of specifications for embedding chips in credit cards and processing transactions from such cards.
    *   MasterCard and Visa have also issued deadlines for compliance with these specifications, indicating that banks will have to bear a large portion of fraud losses if they do not comply.
    *   However, the market response has been slow due to the large investments needed to implement EMV-compliant programs.

In summary, the document discusses the use of biometrics and smart cards in enhancing the security of credit card transactions. While biometrics show promise, smart cards are already being implemented with significant security benefits, including advanced encryption capabilities. However, the adoption of smart card technology is hindered by the slow uptake of smart card-reading terminals globally.The image presents a page from a document titled "Understanding Credit Card Frauds" and is labeled as page 13 of 13. The content is divided into two main sections: a text passage and a bar graph.

**Text Passage:**

*   The title "Managing the Total Cost of Fraud" is prominently displayed.
*   The passage discusses the importance of minimizing the total cost of fraud, which includes both financial loss due to fraud and the cost of fraud prevention systems.
*   It highlights that too often, success is measured exclusively by one metric - the monthly chargeback rate.
*   The optimal level of review is discussed, and the appropriate number of transactions to be reviewed is emphasized as crucial for achieving an optimal balance between reducing fraud losses and overheads associated with reviewing transactions.

**Bar Graph:**

*   The graph is titled "Figure 2: Minimizing the total cost of fraud."
*   It illustrates the trade-off between fraud reduction and the cost of achieving that reduction.
*   The graph depicts the total cost of fraud as the sum of actual fraud losses plus the cost of review, which is typically proportional to the volume of transactions being reviewed.
*   Three scenarios are presented:
    *   Insufficient Screening: 2.6% (dark green) + 1.0% (light purple) = 3.6%
    *   Balanced Screening: 0.3% (dark green) + 5.0% (light purple) = 5.3%
    *   Excessive Reviews: 30.0% (light purple) + 0.6% (dark green) = 30.6%

**Footer:**

*   The footer features the logos of Tata Consultancy Services and Tata, along with the page number "Page 13 of 13."

In summary, the image effectively conveys the importance of managing the total cost of fraud by striking a balance between reducing fraud losses and minimizing the cost of review. The bar graph provides a clear visual representation of the trade-offs involved in different screening scenarios, helping readers understand the optimal approach to minimizing the total cost of fraud.The image presents a page from a document discussing credit card fraud, titled "Understanding Credit Card Fraud" at the top right corner. The page is divided into two sections: the main body and a conclusion.

**Main Body:**

* The text discusses the cost of reviewing transactions to detect fraud, highlighting that it is directly proportional to the volume of transactions being reviewed.
* It emphasizes the importance of minimizing review costs by segmenting transactions, products, and cardholders to determine the profile of potentially fraudulent transactions.
* The risk of fraud varies for each transaction, and there are factors that help determine the risk associated with a particular transaction.

**Conclusion:**

* As card business transactions increase, so do frauds.
* Global networking presents new opportunities for criminals as it does for businesses.
* While offering numerous advantages and opening up new channels for transaction business, the internet has also brought an increased probability of fraud in credit card transactions.
* Technology for preventing credit card frauds is improving many folds with the passage of time.
