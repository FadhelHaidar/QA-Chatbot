Cardholders may experience financial loss, damage to their credit score, and emotional distress. Merchants may lose sales, incur chargeback fees, and face reputational damage. Banks and issuers may absorb financial losses, incur costs associated with investigating and resolving fraud cases, and potentially face regulatory penalties.\\n\\nTo better understand the impact on cardholders, we can look at data from the credit card fraud database. For instance, the average financial loss per cardholder due to credit card fraud is around $528. \\n\\nTo gain more insights, investigators could query the database to analyze trends in fraud types, merchant categories, or geographical regions. This information can help identify areas where cardholders are most vulnerable and inform strategies to mitigate these risks.\",\n",
